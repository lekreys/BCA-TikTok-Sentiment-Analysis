        "# Klasifikasi Komplain Komentar TikTok Bank BCA\n",

        "Proyek ini menggabungkan sentiment analysis dengan klasifikasi komplain pada komentar TikTok yang berkaitan dengan Bank BCA. Setelah mengumpulkan data komentar melalui web scraping, saya menggunakan pendekatan machine learning untuk menganalisis sentimen (positif, negatif, netral) dari setiap komentar.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sebagai langkah lanjutan, saya membagi komentar tersebut ke dalam beberapa kategori komplain, yaitu:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Aplikasi (App): Komentar yang berkaitan dengan masalah teknis atau pengalaman pengguna pada aplikasi BCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Layanan (Service): Komentar yang menyoroti layanan pelanggan atau fasilitas yang disediakan oleh Bank BCA.\n",
        "*   Non Kategori (Non Category): Komentar yang tidak sesuai dengan kategori komplain tertentu.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Kartu Kredit (Credit Card): Komentar yang berkaitan dengan produk kartu kredit Bank BCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Dengan membagi komentar ke dalam kategori ini, proyek ini memberikan wawasan yang lebih terperinci tentang masalah yang dihadapi pengguna, sehingga dapat membantu Bank BCA untuk lebih fokus dalam meningkatkan layanan sesuai dengan feedback pelanggan."
